# Egor Gorshenkov

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! My name is Egor and I am a student at the Higher School of Economics
in Moscow, studying Economics and Data Analysis. As a developer, I have 
experience with Rust, Python, and Golang. I have been involved in various
projects and have even started a YouTube channel, as well as occasionally
streaming on Twitch.

Recently, I decided to dive into open-source development in order to gain more
experience with Rust and Go programming. My goal is to open a DeFi 
(decentralized finance) startup that will revolutionize the way we approach
lending.
